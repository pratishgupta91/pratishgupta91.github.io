A few days back, the railway minister of India presented the Railway budget for this financial year. I am not goinn to take a good or a bad site. I am just trying to analyze the seniments of the people and the political leaders. But before that, let's have a cursory look at the main points of the railway budget.

* No hike in passenger fares.
* Swacch Bharat: 17000 biotoilets and additional toilets in 475 stations before the close of this financial year.
* Wifi at 100 stations this year and 400 stations next year.
* All major stations to be brought under CCTV surveillance in a phased manner.
* Cleaning of toilets by requests through SMS.
* IRCTC to manage catering service in phased manner. Local cuisine of choice will be made available to passengers.
* GPS-based digital display in coaches for showing upcoming stations.
* Introduce bar-coded tickets on pilot basis to tackle menace of ticketless travel.
* Overnight double-decker trains to be introduced on business travel routes.

I thought of looking into the reactions that people are giving towards the budget. I started off with the sentiment analysis of #RailBudget2016 on twitter. It looked something like this.

The sentiments reveal that most of the people are tending to like the post. Now let's have a look at what lawmakers have to say about the budget.

Positive ones 

* It was a visionary budget, many steps laid out which will improve infrastructure
* Nothing new in Rail Budget 2016, except for bio vacuum toilets, but I don't know how successful it will be
* The Minister is trying to make Railways more popular by taking realistic measures
* Under BJP, the Railway Ministry has derailed totally
* It was overall a very good budget, will give this Railway Budget 9 out of 10 marks
* We all were a bit mystified whether a budget was really presented or not
* It is a very well thought out Railway Budget, makes clear its contribution to nation's economy
