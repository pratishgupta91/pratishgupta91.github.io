In the midst of a sandy desert,    
a vagabond wayfarer   
traveled by the horizon   
to voyage a far place.   

Alone, he cruised alone,   
along the curvy brook he had met.   
And his arcane charisma leaded him,   
towards destiny, the master had set.  

Spent endless eternal nights,   
to gaze upon the mystic azure.   
And got merely, an esoteric rhyme   
to softly hum and choir.   

His rusty brown hair,   
resonated with the breeze insane.   
His eyes merely open,   
exposed an ounce of painâ€¦.(incomplete)
