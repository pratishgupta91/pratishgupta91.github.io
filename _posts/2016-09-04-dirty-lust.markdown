I snuffle a vile hatred,   
Which you diligently conceal   
Beneath the polychrome curtain   
Of your dark smiling appeal.   
   
I stare at your beguiling eyes,   
I see a dirty lust   
Smearing your pure soul   
With ravenous reddish rust.   
   
I love you like the moon.   
You, ruthless, choose to betray,   
And puncture my beating heart   
To steal the dripping romance away.
