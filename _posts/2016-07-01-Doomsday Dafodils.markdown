Standing tall all around.   
Gulping green all around.   
Shedding sulfur all around.   
Killing killing all around.   
   
Rusty rainbows in brown background.   
Colossal carcasses, no footsteps found.   
Invisible riders on merry-go-round.   
No sound, no sound.   
   
Metallic seas devouring fast   
From the deeds of our witless past.   
Leading towards the nebula blast.   
Holocaust! Holocaust!   
   
Shiny stars standing far.   
Smelling poison from our evil cigar.   
No resurrection, only war.   
Red scar, red scar.   
   
Greedy Gods, we are.   
Ending races, we are.   
Making morgues, we are.   
Doomsday daffodils, we are.
