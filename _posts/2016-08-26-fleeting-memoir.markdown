> Sit close, have a drink with me,   
For, my time here is ebbing away.   
Talk tangy and smile at me,   
For, I belong to the past May.   
   
Said boyish boffin   
To the dainty lady at the bar.   
Her aura was reminiscent of   
His jovial young memoir.   

He asked her for a dance.   
How could she deny?   
For, his smell was evocative of   
Her favourite apple pie.   

She knew who he was.   
Yet,   
Shackled by love,   
She did not dare to ask.   

He knew who she was.   
But,   
Cursed by reality,   
He did not care to unmask.   
   
They danced all night,   
They danced round and round.   
They kissed all night,   
They kissed round and round.   
   
Petty pleasant present passed.   
And then he vanished too fast   
In the grave of his ominous past   
Near the 54th downing west-mart.   
   
He died last May and   
He died like a fool.   
His lady was still pretty   
Like a cheery crescent moon.   
   
Alas! he died too soon.
