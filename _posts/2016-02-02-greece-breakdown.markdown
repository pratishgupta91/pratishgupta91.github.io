### The bigger picture
In 2001 euro currency was introduced in [Eurozone] countries to cut trade costs and proliferate trade volumes. But back then in 2001, the labor cost of core Eurozone countries such as Germany was much more lower than the [labor costs] of peripheral countries such as Greece. Hence, Greece started falling behind in export and developed trade deficit over the years. This means that Greece started consuming more then what it produced. Hence, to address its trade deficit and budget deficit, it started burrowing money from the other Eurozone countries. 

As the [Great Recession] that began in the U.S. in 2007–2009 spread to Europe, the flow of funds lent from the European core countries (e.g., Germany, France, and Italy) to the peripheral countries to dry up. Also, reports in 2009 of Greek fiscal mismanagement and deception increased borrowing costs; the combination meant Greece could no longer borrow to finance its trade and budget deficits.

### How did Greece landed up in this mess?
* Greek governments bought votes by bestowing unaffordable pensions on civil servants and retirees more generally, compounded the problem by failing to collect taxes properly, and went on a borrowing even more.

* The financial markets failed to properly price Greek credit risk. The fact the euro was Greece’s currency never meant it was as good a bet financially as Germany. Yet once the Greek government could borrow as cheaply as the German government, it did, and spent with abandon. For instance, to stage the 2004 [Summer Olympics], Greece spent nine times as much as Sydney had four years earlier.
 
* Furthermore, Greece had earlier fudged its budget figures to gain entry to the euro in 2001, as its Finance Minister explicitly admitted in 2004. Greece’s actual budget deficits were 6.44 per cent and 4.13 per cent when they needed to be under 3 per cent to be eligible to join the euro.

If Greece wasn’t in the euro, it could have rejuvenated its economy by printing more of its currency, the [drachma]. This would have plummeted the value of the drachma in international markets, making Greek exports more competitive. It would also lower domestic interest rates, bolstering domestic investment and making it easier for Greek debtors to service their debts. Instead, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014, a form of deflation. This resulted in a significant reduction in income and GDP, resulting in a severe recession and a significant rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio.

But Greece shares its monetary policy with the rest of Europe. And the German-dominated European Central Bank has given Europe a monetary policy that’s about right for Germany, but so tight that it has thrust Greece into a depression. So Greece is squeezed between a crushing debt burden — [177 percent of GDP], about twice the level in the United States — and a deep depression that makes it difficult to raise the money it needs to make its debt payments.

For the last five years, Greece has been negotiating with European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (dubbed “the [Troika]”) for financial assistance with its debt burden. Since 2010, the Troika has been providing Greece with loans in exchange for tax hikes and spending cuts.
